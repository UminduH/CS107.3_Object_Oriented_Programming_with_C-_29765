The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the .NET Framework's execution environment, managing memory, thread management, and garbage collection for .NET programs. It supports multiple languages like C#, Visual Basic, and F#, ensuring they can interoperate seamlessly. CLR enforces security policies to run code within secure boundaries and provides portability by enabling cross-platform development on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, it optimizes performance with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, converting Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime.

The Common Language Specification (CLS) establishes rules and guidelines to ensure interoperability among .NET languages, allowing seamless interaction between code written in different languages. It promotes component reusability by defining a common set of features that all .NET languages should support, enabling the creation of libraries and components usable across various applications. CLS specifies essential language features such as data types, exception handling, and object-oriented constructs to ensure consistency and ease the learning curve for developers. Additionally, it defines how assemblies should be structured and exposed, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different components and libraries.
